## The RFC life-cycle
An RFC goes through the following stages:

Pending: when the RFC is submitted to the RFC category in discussions.
Candidate: when the core team has signaled interest in pursuing an RFC.
Active: when an RFC PR is merged and possibly undergoing implementation.
Landed: when an RFCs proposed changes are shipped in an actual release.
Rejected: when an RFC PR is closed without being merged.
